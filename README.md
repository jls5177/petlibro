> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before setting up the integration in Home Assistant, be sure to review the [Account Management](https://github.com/jjjonesjr33/petlibro/wiki/PetLibro-Account-Management) and [Password Limitations](https://github.com/jjjonesjr33/petlibro/wiki/PetLibro-Password-Limitation) sections in the wiki. This will help ensure a smooth and successful setup process.

### Account Integration
#### Manage your Petlibro account directly within Home Assistant

* View account information (email, username, region, subscription status)
* Update profile details
* Configure time zone and language preferences
* Manage linked devices at the account level
* Access support and diagnostic information
* Options Flow in Home Assistant (⚙️ Configure button) for account settings

### Supported Devices
#### This has been reworked to work with the following devices

### Feeders
* Granary Smart Feeder (PLAF103) | Version 2
* Space Smart Feeder (PLAF107)
* Air Smart Feeder (PLAF108)
* Polar Wet Food Feeder (PLAF109)
* Granary Smart Camera Feeder (PLAF203)
* Granary 2 Vision (PLAF205)
* One RFID Smart Feeder (PLAF301)

### Fountains
* Dockstream Smart Fountain (PLWF105)
* Dockstream RFID Smart Fountain (PLWF305)
* Dockstream 2 Smart Fountain | Plug-In Model (PLWF106) 
* Dockstream 2 Smart Fountain | Cordless Model (PLWF116)

### Litter Boxes
* Luma Smart Litter Box (PLLB001)

### Cameras
* Scout Smart Camera (PLPC001) - cloud status and settings metadata

### PETLIBRO meal dashboard card

Home Assistant 2026.6 and newer shows **PETLIBRO Meal** in the dashboard card
picker when you select a Granary camera feeder's latest meal or event image
entity. The integration provides three device-associated variants without
requiring copied entity IDs:

* **Compact** - a small photo and meal summary for a main dashboard.
* **Photo** - a larger latest-event image with cat, intake, duration, and time.
* **Timeline** - recent meal sensor changes from Recorder, with the current
  latest photo.

Compact and Timeline cards default to full-width, auto-height Sections grid
layouts so their meal details are not compressed into narrow columns.

Go to **Edit dashboard → Add card → By entity**, choose any of the feeder's
`Latest Event` or `Last Meal` entities, then choose one of the PETLIBRO Meal
suggestions under **Community**.

After installing or updating the integration, restart Home Assistant and
refresh the browser once so the versioned card module is loaded.

The image is served through Home Assistant; the card never receives PETLIBRO's
temporary signed media URL. Timeline photos are latest-only. Historical meal
rows require Recorder history for the meal sensors.

If Lovelace resources are configured in YAML mode, add this module resource:

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /petlibro/frontend/petlibro-meal-card.js?v=1.4
      type: module
```

### Pending Device(s)

# In Development
#### This is still a WIP integration, features may or may not be removed at any time. If you have suggestions please let me know.
> [!NOTE]
  >* Tracking RFID per pet intance eat/drink - (PLWF305) - API Information gathered, working on implementation.
  >* Camera worklog metadata and event thumbnails are available when PETLIBRO returns them. Scout Smart Camera (PLPC001) cloud metadata is supported, but a live camera feed is not yet implemented.
  >* Live feeds for Granary Smart Camera Feeder (PLAF203), Granary 2 Vision (PLAF205), and Scout Smart Camera (PLPC001) use Kalay/TUTK and require a separate compatible media bridge. Cloud API support does not by itself provide an RTSP, HLS, or WebRTC stream.

# NOTICE
#### Alpha/Beta state notice for this plugin:
> [!WARNING]
>* When setting up for the first time, please sign in and allow 1-5 minutes for the login process and data retrieval to complete. If you do not see all the sensors and controls listed, you may need to refresh your web browser's cache.
>* I recommend performing a full reboot of Home Assistant to ensure you are logged in and that the add-on has refreshed the data without any errors. 
>* The addon is programmed to update every 60 seconds.

## Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot your Home Assistant instance, you can add the following configuration to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning  # Default log level for all components
  logs:
    custom_components.petlibro: debug    # Enable debug logging for your component
```

## Installation (Automatic)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a HACS custom integration — not a Home Assistant Add-on. Don't try to add this repository as an add-on in Home Assistant.
> 
> The IMHO simplest way to install this integration is via the two buttons below ('_OPEN HACS REPOSITORY ON MY HA_' and '_ADD INTEGRATION TO MY HA_').
